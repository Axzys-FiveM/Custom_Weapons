Installation:
1. Start off with creating a folder named "[weapons]".
2. Add a file inside of the "[weapons]" folder and name the new folder "guns".
3. Once you've done that, drag and drop the __resource.lua into the "guns" folder.
4. Last thing you want to do is create and new folder inside of the "guns" folder named "stream"
5. Drag and drop your custom weapons into the "stream" folder and have fun with your custom weapons!
